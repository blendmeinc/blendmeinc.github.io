# Blend Me, Inc Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio source code that is built with Sculpin, SASS and Bootstrap. This page is a combination of Sculpin's original directions with some of my personal notes and reminders.   

Sculpin is a static site generator written in PHP. It converts Markdown files, Twig templates or standard HTML into a static HTML site that can be easily deployed.
